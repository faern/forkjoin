//! A work stealing fork-join parallelism library.
//!
//! Inspired by the blog post [Data Parallelism in Rust](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/data-parallelism-in-rust/)
//! and implemented as part of a master's thesis.
//!
//! This library has been developed to accommodate the needs of three types of
//! algorithms that all fit very well for fork-join parallelism.
//!
//! # Summa style
//!
//! Summa style is where the algorithm receive an argument, recursively compute a value
//! from this argument and return one answer. Examples of this style include recursively
//! finding the n:th Fibonacci number and summing of tree structures.
//! Characteristics of this style is that the algorithm does not need to mutate its
//! argument and the resulting value is only available after every subtask has been
//! fully computed.
//!
//! ## Example of summa style
//!
//!     use forkjoin::{TaskResult,Fork,ForkPool,AlgoStyle};
//!
//!     fn fib_30_with_4_threads() {
//!         let forkpool = ForkPool::with_threads(4);
//!         let result_port = forkpool.schedule(fib_task, 30);
//!         let result: usize = result_port.recv().unwrap();
//!         assert_eq!(1346269, result);
//!     }
//!
//!     fn fib_task(n: usize) -> TaskResult<usize, usize> {
//!         if n < 2 {
//!             TaskResult::Done(1)
//!         } else {
//!             TaskResult::Fork(Fork{
//!                 fun: fib_task,
//!                 args: vec![n-1,n-2],
//!                 join: AlgoStyle::Summa(fib_join)})
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     fn fib_join(values: &[usize]) -> usize {
//!         values.iter().fold(0, |acc, &v| acc + v)
//!     }
//!
//! # Search style
//!
//! Search style return results continuously and can sometimes start without any
//! argument, or start with some initial state. The algorithm produce one or multiple
//! output values during the execution, possibly aborting anywhere in the middle.
//! Algorithms where leafs in the problem tree represent a complete solution to the
//! problem (Unless the leave represent a dead end that is not a solution and does
//! not spawn any subtasks), for example nqueens and sudoku solvers, have this style.
//! Characteristics of the search style is that they can produce multiple results
//! and can abort before all tasks in the tree have been computed.
//!
//! ## Example of search style
//!
//!     use forkjoin::{ForkPool,TaskResult,Fork,AlgoStyle};
//!
//!     type Queen = usize;
//!     type Board = Vec<Queen>;
//!     type Solutions = Vec<Board>;
//!
//!     fn search_nqueens() {
//!         let n: usize = 8;
//!         let empty = vec![];
//!
//!         let forkpool = ForkPool::with_threads(4);
//!         let par_solutions_port = forkpool.schedule(nqueens_task, (empty, n));
//!
//!         let mut solutions: Vec<Board> = vec![];
//!         loop {
//!             match par_solutions_port.recv() {
//!                 Err(..) => break, // Channel is closed to indicate termination
//!                 Ok(board) => solutions.push(board),
//!             };
//!         }
//!         let num_solutions = solutions.len();
//!         println!("Found {} solutions to nqueens({}x{})", num_solutions, n, n);
//!     }
//!
//!     fn nqueens_task((q, n): (Board, usize)) -> TaskResult<(Board,usize), Board> {
//!         if q.len() == n {
//!             TaskResult::Done(q)
//!         } else {
//!             let mut fork_args: Vec<(Board, usize)> = vec![];
//!             for i in 0..n {
//!                 let mut q2 = q.clone();
//!                 q2.push(i);
//!
//!                 if ok(&q2[..]) {
//!                     fork_args.push((q2, n));
//!                 }
//!             }
//!             TaskResult::Fork(Fork{
//!                 fun: nqueens_task,
//!                 args: fork_args,
//!                 join: AlgoStyle::Search
//!             })
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     fn ok(q: &[usize]) -> bool {
//!         for (x1, &y1) in q.iter().enumerate() {
//!             for (x2, &y2) in q.iter().enumerate() {
//!                 if x2 > x1 {
//!                     let xd = x2-x1;
//!                     if y1 == y2 || y1 == y2 + xd || (y2 >= xd && y1 == y2 - xd) {
//!                         return false;
//!                     }
//!                 }
//!             }
//!         }
//!         true
//!     }
//!
//! # In-place mutation style
//!
//! NOTE: This style works in the current lib version, but it requires very ugly
//! unsafe code!
//!
//! In-place mutation style receive a mutable argument, recursively modifies this value
//! and the result is the argument itself. Sorting algorithms that sort their input
//! arrays are cases of this style. Characteristics of this style is that they mutate
//! their input argument instead of producing any output.
//!
//! Examples of this will come when they can be nicely implemented.
//!
//! # Tasks
//!
//! The small jobs that are executed and can choose to fork or to return a value is the
//! TaskFun. A TaskFun can NEVER block, because that would block the kernel thread
//! it's being executed on. Instead it should decide if it's done calculating or need
//! to fork. This decision is taken in the return value to indicate to the user
//! that a TaskFun need to return before anything can happen.
//!
//! A TaskFun return a `TaskResult`. It can be `TaskResult::Done(value)` if it's done
//! calculating. It can be `TaskResult::Fork(fork)` if it needs to fork.
